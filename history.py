These two identical probes, Venera 16A and Venera 16B, deployed onto Venus’s surface in 1981 and 1982, respectively, where they spent just over 700 Earth-minutes transmitting close-up photographs and data about the planet’s atmosphere, surface composition, and temperature. Despite the incredibly harsh conditions – extreme heat, pressure, and corrosive atmosphere – the probes provided the first direct visual evidence of Venus’s surface, revealing features like volcanic plains, impact craters, and bright, reflective materials, fundamentally changing our understanding of this enigmatic world.",

It was the first spacecraft to successfully enter the atmosphere of another planet – Venus – achieving a brief but groundbreaking descent. While only transmitting data for a mere 90 minutes before succumbing to the extreme heat and pressure, Venera 4 provided the first-ever measurements of atmospheric pressure (90 atmospheres) and temperature (464°C or 867°F) on Venus. These initial data points were utterly unexpected, confirming theories about a scorching, highly pressurized environment, and fundamentally shifted the focus of Venus exploration towards understanding its incredibly hostile conditions. Despite its short lifespan, Venera 4’s data proved invaluable, paving the way for subsequent, more successful Venera missions.",
